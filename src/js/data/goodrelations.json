      "en" : "A placeholder instance for unknown instances of a mass-produced commodity. This is used as a computationally cheap work-around for such instances that are not individually exposed on the Web but just stated to exist (i.e., which are existentially quantified).\n\nExample: An instance of this class can represent an anonymous set of green Siemens1234 phones. It is different from the gr:ProductOrServiceModel Siemens1234, since this refers to the make and model, and it is different from a particular instance of this make and model (e.g. my individual phone) since the latter can be sold only once.\n\nNote: This class is the new, shorter form of the former gr:ProductOrServicesSomeInstancesPlaceholder.\n\t\t\nCompatibility with schema.org: This class is (approximately) a subclass of http://schema.org/Product."
